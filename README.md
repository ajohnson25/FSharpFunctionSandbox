# FSharpFunctionSandbox
This is an F# repository that contains functions that could be implemented into other projects.  The code is primarily in the Library project (FSharpFunctionSandbox) which is used by the Console application (Execute) and xUnit (Test).  The code used here is subject to change so the code here should be implemented into more stable projects instead of using it from this one.
